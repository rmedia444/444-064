                <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify md:mx-10 mx-5">
                    In 2010, alternative proteins, such as plant-based and lab-grown meat, were gaining attention as sustainable food sources. Companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods were developing products that mimicked the taste and texture of traditional meat, appealing to both vegetarians and meat-eaters.

                    The growth of alternative proteins aimed to address environmental concerns, such as the carbon footprint of livestock farming and the ethical considerations of animal welfare. This period marked a significant shift towards more sustainable and innovative food production methods, with the potential to transform the global food industry.
