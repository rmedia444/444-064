                    The sharing economy was expanding rapidly in 2010, with companies like Airbnb and Uber leading the way. This economic model emphasized the sharing of resources, such as homes and cars, to maximize their use and reduce waste. The sharing economy provided flexible income opportunities for individuals and offered cost-effective services for consumers.

                    The growth of the sharing economy also raised questions about regulation, worker rights, and the impact on traditional industries. This period marked a significant shift towards collaborative consumption, where access to goods and services was prioritized over ownership.
