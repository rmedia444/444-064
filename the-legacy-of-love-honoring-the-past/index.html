                Our lives are fleeting, like whispers carried away by the wind. Yet, within this ephemeral existence, we have the power to leave a lasting legacy—a legacy of love. It is not measured in material wealth or grand monuments but in the imprints we leave on hearts and minds. We honor the past by cherishing the stories of those who came before us—their triumphs, their struggles, their unwavering love. We shape the future by nurturing the seeds of compassion, wisdom, and courage in the hearts of the next generation. Our legacy is woven into the tapestry of time, connecting us to ancestors and descendants alike. So let us live with intention, love fiercely, and write our chapters in the book of eternity—a legacy that transcends mortality and echoes through eternity.
